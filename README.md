# Resume of Week 3

#### Callback function:

##### A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function

##### This technique allows a function to call another function

##### A callback function can run after another function has finished

#### High-order function:

#### A higher order function is a function that either:

#### 1.Takes one or more functions as arguments

#### 2.Returns a function as its result

### Functions definition:

#### `each.js`

##### 1. Basic each:

###### A function that loop over an array and return each element alone.

##### 2. Improved each:

###### The same as the basic each but the difference is that improved each return each element with his index

##### 3. Object, Array each:

###### We create an each function with data structure, we are taking each to the next level by taking arrays and object with for loop
